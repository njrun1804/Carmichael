# Carmichael

Carmichael is a simple web application built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. The project was bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app) and provides a minimal starting point for experimenting with modern React development.

## Features

- **Next.js App Router** structure
- **TypeScript** configuration
- **Tailwind CSS** styling

## Getting Started

Install dependencies and start the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000> to view the site in your browser.

You can start editing the main page by modifying `src/app/page.tsx`. The page auto‑updates as you edit the file, and you can create additional routes under the `app/` or `src/` directories.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` – Run the development server
- `npm run build` – Create an optimized production build
- `npm start` – Start the production server

## Styling

Styles are built with Tailwind CSS and processed by PostCSS. The [`postcss.config.js`](./postcss.config.js) file loads the `tailwindcss` plugin along with `autoprefixer`, so vendor prefixes are automatically applied where needed.
